**WEATHER APP**

Had a free moment and decided to draft a small Flutter weather app.
It fetches live data from the OpenWeather API, requests location permissions, and adapts between four states: Sunny, Thunderstorm, Cloudy, Rainy.

Added animations and graphics from Lottie, which made the whole experience much more dynamic.
Followed along with this great tutorial for the base logic, link below

Next step, modify the app itself
